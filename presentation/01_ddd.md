# Domain-Driven Design

Blue Book: Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software
by Eric Evans (2003)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a collection of principles and patterns 
that help developers craft elegant object systems.
DDD is not a new doctrine or methodology.

## Strategical DDD

- Ubiquitous language
- Intention-revealing interfaces
- Side-effect-free functions
- Assertions
- Conceptual contours (boundaries)

## Tactical DDD

The approach where DDD is first embraced as a technical toolset 
sometimes referred as DDD-Lite.

The building blocks of a model-driven design condenses a core 
of best practices in object-oriented domain modeling into 
a set of basic building blocks.

The objective of these architecture patterns is to try 
to have the complexity of our application grow more slowly than its size.
