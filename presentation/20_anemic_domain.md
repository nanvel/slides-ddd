# Anemic domain

Anemic domain model is a term used to describe the use of a domain model 
where the domain objects contain little or no business logic.

Signs of an anemic domain model include:
- Data model projected from a relational model into objects
- Too much logic inside use cases
- All the domain logic resides in services rather 
  than mostly spread across Entities and Value Objects
