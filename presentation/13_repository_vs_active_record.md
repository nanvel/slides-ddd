# Repository vs Active Record

![Repository vs Active Record](../images/repository.png)

Active Record pattern uses Data Access Objects (DAO).

DAO is expressed in terms of database tables, providing CRUD interface for them.

Repository pattern uses Domain Objects (DO).

Domain-Driven Design vs Database-Driven Design:
software that doesn't box us in as it grows but creates new opportunities.
